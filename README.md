Arbitrary-images-required-for-creating-an-app-in-iTunes-Connect
===============================================================

iTunes Connect requires you to upload a "Large App Icon", and at least one 3.5-inch and 4-inch image in order to create a new app.  These are what I typically use for an app I'm trying to create, but not ready to publish yet.
